	Shivani Shedde is a practicing architect and graduate student at the Yale School of Architecture's Master of Environmental Design Program. Her work is concerned with State-mandated patterns of (knowledge) production and consumption that facilitate both 
	environmental and social change through the management of space. Her current research 
	on the gold mining industry in South India continues this investigation through the social 
	contract formed between State, the environment and its citizens. Shivani is from Mumbai, 
	India, where she received a Bachelor of Architecture as well as a Diploma in Modern and 
	Contemporary Art History.  She is the recipient of the Yale Centre for British Art's Paul 
	Mellon Travel Grant as well as the Yale Macmillan Centre's Rustgi Fellowship.
